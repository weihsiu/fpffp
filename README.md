# Functional programming from first principles

## Talk abstract

We know writing programs in a functional style has many benefits, and we try to learn all the ways to do functional programming. But do we know why functional programming has to be this way? Why do we need monads when they are so hard to understand?In this talk, we are going to derive some basic building blocks of functional programming from first principles. The set of propositions we constraint ourselves with is fundamental to the power of functional programming and we will show you why constraints are actually liberating when they come to programming.After this talk, you should have a better understanding of why functional programming is the way it is and hopefully will want to pursue it further in the future.

## What’s in the code

I’ve coded up a minimum set of functional programming necessities using many of the new language features of Scala 3. The way I implemented them is different from what’s done in Cats and I think the result is pretty good.The IO implementation is toy at best, but it’s good enough for pedagogical purposes.

## Where are the slides

Slides are in the jcconf2022 folder. There isn’t much in the slides. I will concentrate most of the talk on the implementations of various functional type classes and examples.
